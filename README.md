# E-Cell-Website-V2

Version 2 of E Cell website + TedX page

## Todo - 

1. Create burger menu for nav bar in mobile view
2. Add all council members in team page
3. Add Past success stories (home page)
4. Sort variables and colors in tedX page. rn not consistent

## To refine:
1. CSS - re-structure css so that footer and navbar are in seperate file and can be reused. currently linking multiple sheets can induce conflicting styles (linking index.css + tedx-style.css).

2. TedX red in the tedX page. Interchange TEDx to red and bits to white in the tedx.html hero section.

3. Maybe replace all TedX texts (navbar etc) with actual transparent logo

## to start

1. incubator page or merge it with index.html

# Bugs

1. that stupid tedX navbar formatting. the font is not thick enough
